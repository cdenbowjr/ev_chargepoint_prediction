## Definitions

**EV charge point/charging unit** – a single upstand or wall-mounted structure offering one or more socket outlets or tethered plugs suitable for charging EVs.

**EV charging station** – a physical site with at least one charge point installed suitable for charging at least two EVs. A station usually (but not always) has other physical structures accompanying the charge point(s) such as an energy supply enclosure (feeder pillar), weather shelter, signage, protection barriers for the equipment.

**Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA)** - A government tracked area that has a minimum population size of 5,000 and a maximum population size of 15,000
