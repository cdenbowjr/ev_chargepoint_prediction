## Definitions

**EV charge point/charging unit** – a single upstand or wall-mounted structure offering one or more socket outlets or tethered plugs suitable for charging EVs.

**EV charging station** – a physical site with at least one charge point installed suitable for charging at least two EVs. A station usually (but not always) has other physical structures accompanying the charge point(s) such as an energy supply enclosure (feeder pillar), weather shelter, signage, protection barriers for the equipment.
