### What are the challenges?

|      | Challenges                                                   |
| ---- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | The government must convince the public to "switch" their gasoline/diesel vehicle to Electric vehicles (EVs) |
| 2    | Electricity companies must upgrade their supply and distribution networks to accommodate new electricity demand from road transportation |



### What makes it difficult to "switch"?

|       | Difficulties                                                 |
| :---: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | The public has limited variety of EV choice for purchase compared to gasoline and diesel vehicles |
|   2   | Buying a new EV costs more for the average resident than buying or keeping an existing gasoline/diesel vehicle |
| **3** | **There is a sparse distribution of EV charging infrastructure across Britain resulting in slow adoption of this technology due to "Range Anxiety"** |

### What is one solution?<img src="/reports/figures/switch_electric.jpg" alt="switch_to_electric" width=100%/>



### How can we make this solution effective?

|      | Approach                                                     |
| :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | **Build a model to predict where EV charge point infrastructure is likely to be installed** based on characteristics of a particular geographic area |
|  2   | Understand the profile of geographic area that could "switch to electric" based on available EV charging infrastructure |



### Who are the Stakeholders?

| Stakeholder                                     | Examples                                     | Reason                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Policy Makers, Thinktanks & Local Councils      | HM Government, Milton Keynes local Authority | Useful for any marketing campaign or incentive scheme that involves the public to ensure it will be cost-effective and focused |
| EV charge point installers or service providers | Sourcepoint London, ubitricity               | Useful for any enterprise or business to be proactive about any bids or investment for the installation of charging stations |
| EV Manufacturers                                | Tesla, Nissan, Audi                          | Useful for manufacturers to understand areas that are likely to purchase an EV for their primary or secondary mode of transportation |
| Electricity Distributers and Suppliers          | EDF Energy                                   | Useful for distributers and suppliers of electricity as it will identify the areas of the electricity grid that need investment for future demand from EV transportation |
